The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.

linear discriminant analysis a method used in statistics, pattern recognition and machine learning to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

Sepel:-Usually green, sepals typically function as protection for the flower in bud, and often as support for the petals when in bloom

Petel :- Petals are modified leaves that surround the reproductive parts of flowers.Usually brightly colored
